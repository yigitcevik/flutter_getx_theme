# Flutter Change and Save App Theme With Getx and Get Storage

## Getting Started

You need to install two packages for the project.

1) https://pub.dev/packages/get
2) https://pub.dev/packages/get_storage

I used the GetX package to provide the theme change and the GetStorage package to save the changed theme to the device. Just press the FloatingActionButton to change the theme.
